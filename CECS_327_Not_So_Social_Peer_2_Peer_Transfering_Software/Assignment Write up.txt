This term project was a challenge it took a couple of trys to get everything working properly. 
When I thought I was done i had another error to look at, but it was all worth it. Planning and talking to the professor really helped smooth out the rough parts. 
I think i read the prompt like at least 20 times to make sure I knew everything was good, or to verify that I was correctly doing the work.
My partner and I did a pretty good job with the planning. He was very honset in what he was able to do so it was very easy to get things done. 
We struggled woht the intergration and testing proccess because of COVID but I got it to work, by just using VMs. That was a headache of its own.
Using the async methods made it easier to send files and it definitely helped to have the socket classes have both async and non-async methods to choose from.
I like creating GUIs so using C# allowed me to have that challenge, also it was very irritating to type in the ip address 100 times when debugging also hard coding sensitve information is just bad practice.
Overall, this assignment was very cool, there where alot of happy dances, late night calls, tears of sadness/joy. Hated debugging with a passion, i cant wait to create a code where I have no or little errors. 
Before, and during the development of this application, we used countless of resources.
